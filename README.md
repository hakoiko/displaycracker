# ⚠️ This project is under developing.
I'm developing this site to open in March 2019.

# Display Cracker
People use mobile devices with very different screen sizes. variations in size, resolution and density are very large. You could read a UI guideline of iOS and Android on their web site. but in real project, we have to choose some target devices. 'Display Cracker' is a reference of mobile screens . I hope this reference could be helpful for designers and marketers.
