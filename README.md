# Display Cracker
People use mobile devices with very different screen sizes. Variation of screen size, resolution and density are very large. You could read a UI guideline of iOS and Android on their web site. But in real project, We have to choose some target devices. 'Display Cracker' is a reference of mobile screens . I hope this reference could be helpful for designers and marketers.
